    "description": "Pressing your secondary ability key will give you a massive speed boost that lasts for 10 seconds. During the Sprint, you can press the key again to cancel it. It is worth noting that whilst using this ability, you cannot deal damage and taking damage during the sprint will cancel it and slow you down."
